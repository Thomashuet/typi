<h1>Typi example</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Typi, a simple environment to learn <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> directly in your browser.
Typi allows you to create tutorials that include snippets of code that can be copied to the editor with a double click and feature syntax highlighting.
<pre>(* Example of code *)
print_endline "Hello world!";;</pre>
The code can be be sent from the editor to the interpreter or directly typed into the interpreter.
If it contains an error or raises an exception, a marker will appear in the editor.
<pre>(* Code with type error *)
42 = "42";;</pre>
Tutorials are written in HTML and can contain images, tables, hyperlinks, etc.
</p>

<p>
Tutorials are composed of several questions.
Questions can include one or several tests that remain hidden.
When a question is solved, it is colored in green.

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<p>
Implement a sort function with the following type:
<pre>sort : 'a list -> 'a list</pre>
<pre class="test">
sort [] = []
&& sort ["42"] = ["42"]
&& sort [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7] = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]
&& sort [7; 6; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1] = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]
&& sort [1; 1; 1; 1; 1] = [1; 1; 1; 1; 1]
&& sort [6; 42; 7; 6; 3; 5; 5; 5; 1; 0] = [0; 1; 3; 5; 5; 5; 6; 6; 7; 42]
;;
</pre>
Solution:
<pre>let rec split = function
| [] -> [], []
| [x] -> [x], []
| x :: y :: t ->
  let a, b = split t in
  x :: a, y :: b
;;

let rec merge l1 l2 = match l1, l2 with
| [], l | l, [] -> l
| h1:: t1, h2 :: _ when h1 < h2 -> h1 :: merge t1 l2
| _, h2 :: t2 -> h2 :: merge l1 t2
;;

let rec sort = function
| [] -> []
| [x] -> [x]
| l ->
  let a, b = split l in
  merge (sort a) (sort b)

<h3>Question 2</h3>

<p>
Implement the Fibonacci function (F<sub>0</sub>=0, F<sub>1</sub>=1 and for n > 1, F<sub>n</sub>=F<sub>n-1</sub>+F<sub>n-2</sub>).
<pre>fibo : int -> int</pre>
<pre class="test">
fibo 0 = 0
&& fibo 1 = 1
&& fibo 2 = 1
&& fibo 3 = 2
&& fibo 4 = 3
&& fibo 5 = 5
&& fibo 46 = 1836311903
