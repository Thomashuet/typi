<h1>Typi example</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Typi, a simple environment to learn <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> in the browser.
Typi allows you to create tutorials that include snippets of code that can be copied to the editor with a single click and feature syntax highlighting.
</p>

<pre>(* Example of code *)
print_endline "Hello world!";;</pre>

<p>
The code can be be sent from the editor to the interpreter or directly types into the interpreter.
If it contains an error or raises an exception, a marker will appear in the editor.
</p>

<pre>(* Code with type error *)
42 = "42";;</pre>
